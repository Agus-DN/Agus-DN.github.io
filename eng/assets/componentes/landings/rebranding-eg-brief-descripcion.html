                Previously, the School was called "Escuela Gourmet de Marcos De Lauretis," referring to the name the brand had when it offered in-person classes.

           <p class="brief-descripcion-texto mt-5">
            However, I identified an issue when transitioning to a fully online course sales model. Using the same name as the in-person school caused confusion, as users continued to inquire about in-person classes.
